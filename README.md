# AIML Journey

This repository documents my daily learning journey in **Python and AI/ML** as I work towards becoming an **AI/ML Engineer**.

I use this repo to:

- Track my daily progress
- Store practice code
- Write short notes about what I learn
- Build consistency and discipline

---

## What this repository contains

- **Daily folders (Day-01, Day-02, …)**  
  Each folder includes:

  - `notes.md` → what I learned, practiced, and found confusing
  - `code.py` → Python code written that day

- Gradual progress from **Python basics** to **AI/ML concepts and projects**

---

## 🛠 Current Focus

- Python fundamentals
- Logic building
- Data structures
- Writing clean and readable code

(AI/ML concepts will be added step by step)

---

## Goal

To become a **skilled AI/ML Engineer** with strong fundamentals, real projects, and consistent daily practice.

## Started On

## 7/01/2026

## Note

This repository reflects my **learning process**, so the code may improve and evolve over time.
